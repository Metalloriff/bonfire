# WIP
### NOTE: This page and project are work in progress. I'm currently focusing on the project itself, and only have this repo public for build testing purposes. If you wish to use Bonfire, you're absolutely free to do so, but please note that it's not ready for public testing yet.

# Bonfire
Bonfire is a privacy-based open source, cross-platform and self-hosted text and voice/video chat application with no centralized servers.

Bonfire puts the trust in the users, not a central authority. It can even be used offline on the local network. Your login data and settings are stored on your own device, and everything else is per-server.

# Philosophy
Corporations and governments have rendered privacy and security a distant dream. The days of the free internet are slipping away, and I wish to do my part in preserving it.

Privacy is a fundamental human right, but corporations and governments try to take it from us and convince us otherwise. We've let them get to the point of asking for ID verification to use basic chat services. F*ck that. Give the power back to the people.

We pay for slight conveniences, not only with our money, but with our dignity. In my eyes, hosting your own server is a small price to pay for peace of mind.

I've done everything in my power to make this project as easy as possible to host, and I hope for people to take that slight inconvenience and take back control of their privacy and data.

## Notable Features
- No centralized servers
- Password-protected servers
- End-to-end encryption on private messages (DMs)
- The ability to send password-protected messages and files
- MCU-based voice/video chat
- The option to purge all of your messages and files when leaving a server
- Built in the Godot engine, so you can easily mod and customize the client and server
- Per-server profiles, completely detaching the server's knowledge of your identity
- The ability to download files without opening a web browser first (truly revolutionary technology)
- Smooth animations and a responsive UI. No more freezing and lagging when interacting with the client.
- Lightweight. While it's not the most lightweight chat client out there, it packs a punch for its small footprint, and easily runs smoother and lighter than every web-based client.

## Missing Expected Features
Some of the features that are missing from modern chat services, and the reasons:
- ID verification
	- This is a joke. It's never happening.
- Push Notifications
	- I've not yet been able to find a way to handle push notifications in Godot, especially a privacy-friendly solution. This is a high priority feature that I'm trying to find a solution for. If you have any leads, please create an issue or pull request.

## Screenshots
Nothing here.

## Server Setup
Nothing here.

## Security
Please note that this is my first project of this scale, and I'm not a security expert. I have made this project as secure as possible, but there are likely some security holes. If you find any, please let me know with an issue or pull request.

In general, I would recommend using this project with people you trust in its early stages, especially considering that is the project's primary purpose.

## Donations
If you'd like to support me, you can donate however is most convenient for you. Anything helps keep this project alive. Thank you! ❤️

## AI Usage
Since this is a big thing for a lot of people, I wish to remain as clear as possible. >99% of the code in this project is written by me, and anything that is AI-assisted is clearly marked as such with code comments. This is **NOT** a vibe-coded project.
